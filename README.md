# Hang-On
Much simpler version of SEGA 1985 Hang-On

## Scope
The scope of this project was to recreate the first level of the game Hang-On. Both physics and graphics have been simplified for ease purposes and due
to the lack of information available, apart from videos of the original game. Some other functionalities such as score register have not been implemented.  

## Requirements
To run this program SDL2 library is needed. This library is responsible for most of the memory leakage.
